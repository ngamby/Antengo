# Antengo
So this is Antengo by Noah Gamboa. It has a few really cool features and builds solely on AngularJS and Bootstrap. You can browse and explore listings as well as buy and sell. There are a couple of ways to get started. you may want to create a server on localHost (at least I had to do that) if simply opening up index.html doesn't work. I just ran it with python. if you cd into the directive that contains index.html and run this piece:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Be sure you have python installed. Then you can effectively create a server on your local http. copy the adress (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) into your browser and you should be set. 


One issue: some of the images had dead links and I did not try to replace them. I have methods to replace the image but every get request returns 404. that shows up in the console.
